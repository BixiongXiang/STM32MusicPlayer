# STM32MusicPlayer
STM32MusicPlayer, designed by IAR, controls the machine to paly music.

This is a program developed on STM32 micro controller, which I used all the basic devices on the STM32. 
Including LCD screen, Mic, key board, GPIO, USART, I2C, etc.

Because of my music knowledge, I came up the thought to make a music player from STM32. I generate the wave using PMW wave, 
and adjust its frequency and duty to control the tone. With the help of DAC I can transfer the data to music that we can hear.
